Placeholder for WebM video files

The following video files should be placed in this directory:

1. how-it-works-process.webm - A premium WebM video showing the step-by-step process of AI SOP generation
2. ai-in-action-demo.webm - A premium WebM video demonstrating AI in action with real-time processing

These videos should be:
- High quality (1080p or higher)
- Optimized for web (compressed WebM format)
- 10-30 seconds in length
- Looping seamlessly
- Using brand colors (#003366 deep blue and #66CC99 soft green)
- Minimal and futuristic aesthetic

For now, the application will fall back to premium Lottie animations if these videos are not available.
